Attached here is my UML with notes about the project.

AI Reflection:
The only thing I used AI for was to understand how <<abstract>> and <<interface>> were to be placed in the UML. Looking back, it was wholly unnecessary. I had used Chat GPT.

AI prompt:
Thats fine. Where would you put the words abstract and interface

Response:

In UML class diagrams, you show abstract classes and interfaces in special ways:

ðŸ”¹ Abstract Class

The class name is italicized or marked with Â«abstractÂ».

Abstract methods are also italicized.

Example with your Shape:
+----------------+
                | Â«abstractÂ»     |
                |     Shape      |
                +----------------+
                | - color:String |
                | - name:String  |
                +----------------+
                | + area():double|
                | + draw():void  |
                +----------------+
This tells the reader you canâ€™t create a Shape directly â€” only subclasses like Circle or Hexagon.
