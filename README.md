Short Explanation:

Part 1.
I designed the class relationship to be connected through a single abstract class because most items in basic video games work similarly to each other. It is very easy to inherit methods in use for different things in each subclass.  There are four subclasses (Weapons, Consumables, Armor) that inherit from the Item abstract class, and are used by the Inventory class to make an instance of each desired class in order to "fill the inventory". This could be used in a larger game as an inventory system to track and store items throughout the game, inheriting more subclasses for any desired item variants. 

Part 2. 
I added the Tools subclass to help scale the amount of possibilities for extensions of the Item abstract class. They help scaling by showing the different ways each method can be overridden to do any desired actions for the subclass
